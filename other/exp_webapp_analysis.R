# This file presents an example data preprocessing for the Experimental Web App
# results. Actually, a better way may be to get the aggregate results from each
# participant already in the loop (see LukÃ¡cs, 2021, TQMP). However, people
# often prefer all raw data to be merged together in a single table (with single
# pieces of information as constants in dedicated columns per participant). The
# present script accomplishes this.
